# Habit_builder
A program that I developed to help myself build routines and habits. Works on a (customizable) point system where you click the correspnding button everytime you are inconsistent with one of your goals, and you lose an adjustable amount of points (which you can regain daily by simply following through on your habits).


-CUSTOMIZING YOUR HABITS-

Since this is a customizable program, you must edit the names and penalties of the default "Habits".
If you want, you can remove or add new habits by simply adding a new tuple with the template: ("habit name", penalty).
The tuple must be added to the "habits" list.
